Budget Buddy

We focused 4 main aspects, the algorithm itself, the image scan, reading json files, 
and the front end HTML. For the algorithm, we used Javascript and using input of current spending from the HTML itself and 
calculated optimized savings and more. For the image scan, using Google Cloud Vision API, we were able to implement high accuracy text recognition from the image input.
We read the json file using the fs library, and made the data given from the image usable on our side. 
Lastly for the front end, we used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a interactive, user friendly, front end for Budget Buddy. 

Error Handling:
We were very focused on user friendliness and we wanted to make sure user's did not have to deal with any major errors. We set the default values to the values for the average american, such as monthly income and general bills that we used to test. 
We would advise you to test with the general monthly income first; 4277 to test the values and use the bill given as a test to make sure its compatible with your browser.
